HELP_16_Title: 'سوال 16: چگونه موجودی حساب خود را ببینم؟ ',
HELP_16_Desc_1: 'برای این کار می توانید از یک مرورگر بلاکچین مثل  [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) استفاده کنید. آدرس خود را در قسمت search (جستجو) وارد کنید و بعد می توانید آدرس و سابقه تراکنش های خود را مشاهده کنید. برای مثال حساب اهدایی ما [بدین صورت](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8) است. ',

HELP_17_Title: 'سوال 17: چرا زمانی که قفل کیف پول خود را باز می کنم موجودی من نمایش داده نمی شود؟ ',
HELP_17_Desc_1: 'این موضوع احتمالا بخاطر این است که شما پشت یک firewall (دیوار آتشین) هستید. API که ما برای بدست آوردن موجودی استفاده می کنیم به دلایلی معمولا توسط فایر وال ها بلاک می شوند. شما همچنان می توانید تراکنش هایتان را ارسال کنید و برای دیدن موجودی خود تنها باید از راه دیگری (مثل etherscan.io) استفاده کنید.

HELP_18_Title: 'سوال 18: فایل مربوط به کیف پول geth کجا قرار دارد؟ ',

HELP_19_Title: 'سوال 19: فایل مربوط به کیف پول Mist من کجا قرار دارد؟ ',
HELP_19_Desc_1: 'فایل های Mist معمولا در فضاهای بالا قرار دارند. اما را آسان تر این است که Mist را باز کنید، در قسمت بالا گزینه Accounts و بعد Backup را انتخاب کنید. این کار پوشه ای که فایل های شما در آن ذخیره شده را باز می کند. ',

HELP_20_Title: 'سوال 20: فایل مربوط به کیف پول پیش فروش (pre-sale) من کجا قرار دارد؟ ',
HELP_20_Desc_1: 'هر جایی که آن را ذخیره کرده اید! البته برای ایمیل شما هم ارسال شده است، در نتیجه آن را نیز بررسی کنید. بدنبال فایلی با نام ""ethereum_wallet_backup.json"" بگردید. این فایلِ کیف پول با یک رمزعبور رمزنگاری شده است. رمزعبوری که شما هنگام خرید در پیش فروش ساخته اید. ',

HELP_21_Title: 'سوال 21: آیا این امکان وجود ندارد که هر کسی یک کلید خصوصی تصادفی (رندوم) را وارد کرده و بدنبال یک موجودی بگردد و سپس آن را برای خود ارسال کند؟ ',
HELP_21_Desc_1: 'جواب کوتاه: بله، اما یافتن یک حساب با موجودی، بیش از هزاران سال طول می کشد؛ پس جواب خیر است. ',
HELP_21_Desc_2: 'نسخه Long ELI5: اتریوم بر پایه Public Key Cryptography یا رمزنگاری کلید عمومی و بطور خاص، منحنی رمزنگاری Elliptic است که بصورت گسترده ای نیز مورد استفاده قرار می گیرد. امنیت بسیاری از سرورها از طریق ECC فراهم می شود. بیتکوین نیز از همان، و از چیزهای دیگری مثل SSH و TLS استفاده می کند. کلیدهای اتریوم کلیدهای 256 بیتی هستند که بسیار قوی تر از مدل های 128بیتی و 192بیتی هستند که بصورت گسترده ای مورد استفاده قرار می گیرند و از نظر کارشناسان امن هستند. ',
HELP_21_Desc_3: 'در اینجا شما یک کلید خصوصی و یک کلید عمومی دارید. از کلید خصوصی می توان کلید عمومی ساخت، اما کلید عمومی را نمی توان برگرداند و به کلید خصوصی تبدیل کرد یا از طریق آن کلید خصوصی را بدست آورد. تمام دنیا و اینترنت در حال استفاده از این نوع رمزنگاری هستند و اگر راهی برای بدست آوردن کلید خصوصی از طریق کلید عمومی وجود داشته باشد و به این خاطر شما اترهای خود را از دست دهید، این موضوع کمترین نگرانی هر کسی خواهد بود. ',
HELP_21_Desc_4: 'اگر کسی کلید خصوصی شما را داشته باشد می تواند از حساب شما اتر منتقل کند؛ درست همانطور که اگر کسی رمزعبور ایمیل شما را داشته باشد می تواند ایمیل هایتان را بخواند و یا ایمیل ارسال کند، یا اگر کسی رمزعبور حساب شما را داشته باشد می تواند پول جابجا کند. می توانید نسخه Keystore کلید خصوصی خود، که کلید خصوصیِ رمزنگاری شده با یک رمزعبور است را دانلود کنید. این کار مثل این است که یک رمزعبوری دارید که توسط یک رمزعبور دیگر محافظت می شود. ',
HELP_21_Desc_5: 'بصورت تئوری این امکان وجود دارد که رشته هایی با 64 کاراکتر هگزادسیمالی وارد کنید تا یکی از آن ها کار کند و کلید خصوصی از آب در بیاید. البته افراد باهوش برای این کار برنامه ای می نویسند که با سرعت بالا کلیدهای خصوصی تصادفی مختلفی را امتحان کند. به این کار Brute-force یا نیروی کور و یا در اصطلاحی دیگر به آن mining یا استخراج کلید خصوصی گفته می شود. با تعداد کمی سرورهای قوی، احتمال چک کردن بیش از 1میلیون کلید در درثانیه وجود دارد. اما چک کردن این تعداد کلید در ثانیه نمی تواند هزینه های فعالیت سرورها را پوشش دهد و احتمالا نه تنها شما بلکه فرزندان و نوه های شما نیز نمی توانند کلیدی پیدا کند. ',
HELP_21_Desc_6: 'اگر چیزی درباره بیتکوین می دانید، برای نشان دادن اینکه این احتمال چقدر کم است به این نکته توجه کنید: فرض کنید هر ساتوشی از هر بیتکوینی که تا به حال ساخته شده به کلید خصوصی یکتای مربوط به خود رفته باشد. احتمال آنکه بین تمام آن کلیدها، دو کلید وجود داشته باشد که هر دو به یک آدرس اشاره کنند حدود یک در 100 کوینتیلیون (کوینتیلیون معادل است با 1 و هجده صفر جلوی آن که کل آن ها به توان 2 برسد) است. ',
HELP_21_Desc_7: 'این عددها هیچ ربطی با فناوری دستگاه ها ندارند؛ مقدارها بیشینه یا ماکزیمی هستند که از نظر ترمودینامیکی مجاز است و شدیده بر این موضوع دلالت دارد که حمله های نیروی کور یا brute force به کلیدهای 256بیتی تا زمانی که کامپیوترهایی با چیزی غیر از چیزهای فعلی ساخته شود و چیزی غیر از فضا را اشغال کند ساخته شوند غیر عملی است. ',
HELP_21_Desc_8: 'این موضوع نشانگر آن است که کلیدها بصورت کاملا تصادفی و با آنتروپی کافی ساخته می شوند. کلیدهایی که اینجا ساخته می شوند همانند Jaxx و Mist/geth از این معیار پیروی می کنند. کیف پول های اتریوم همگی خوب هستند. کلیدهای که توسط ذهن انسان ساخته می شوند خوب نیستند چرا که ذهن انسان توان ایجاد یک دانه یا رمز کاملا تصدفی را ندارد. مشکلاتی در زمینه آنتروپی و یا اینکه دانه ها بطور کاملا تصدفی ساخته نشدند در دنیای بیتکوین وجود داشته که موضوعی ست که باید بعدا راجع به آن صحبت کرد.

HELP_SecCX_Desc_4: 'آدرس، نام اختصاری و کلید خصوصی در chrome.storage ذخیره می شود. کلید خصوصی با استفاده از رمزعبوری که در زمان اضافه کردن کیف پول انتخاب کردید رمزنگاری شده است. نام اختصاری و کیف پول رمزنگاری نشده است. ',
HELP_SecCX_Desc_5: 'چرا نام اختصاری و کیف پول رمزنگاری نمی شوند؟ ',
HELP_SecCX_Desc_6: 'اگر می خواستیم این موارد را رمزنگاری کنیم، هربار که می خواستید موجودی حساب یا نام های اختصاری را ببینید مجبور به وارد کردن رمزعبور می شدید. اگر این موضوع برایتان مهم است، پیشنهاد می کنیم از MyEtherWallet.com به جای این Chrome Extension استفاده کنید. ',
